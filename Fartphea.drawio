Some farts might make someone sick or turn the farter invisible for a duration. Too many farts around a person who&#39;s not the killer dies. The game plays in a mansion where there are many rooms plus a very big ball room where all the players start. Up to 5 players/AIs can exit through the roof and safely fly away in the mansion owner&#39;s chopper. If the murderer kills all but one person the murder wins. Players can vote on who the murderer is and throw them off the roof. If players throw the murderer off the roof the chopper explodes and they have to hide from invading aliens for 2 minute. Murderer has at least a 10 second wait time between farts. It takes 3-5 farts to kill a person. The key to the chopper is hidden on one of the staff in the building." style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
